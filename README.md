**`Problem-solving generalist // a.k.a. Fullstack Web Dev`**

I am a WIP full-stack web developper, on my way to help organizations and enterprises resolve hard problems with smart solutions. I started to learn web development in Decemeber 2022, as a late shift in career, because I want to help people to live better lives through software. Everything here is my contribution to the comunity and my playground to learn., and has been built from scratch.
